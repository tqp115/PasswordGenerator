# PasswordGenerator

This Python script generates a random password for the user without using the "secrets", "random", or any similar library. Instead, the script achieves "randomness" using the datetime library. This script is run from the command-line with argparse. The user can set the script to include/exclude letters, numbers, symbols, etc.
